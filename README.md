# ResNet9 object recognition

### This project is a tutorial and guide for getting higher accuracies on cifar-10 classifiers
### I used the following techniques and have analyzed how they effect the accuracy and loss of the classifier. 

- Residual Network(ResNet9)
- Learning rate scheduling
- Weight Decay
- Gradient clipping
- Adam optimizer

### I was able to achieve above 93% accuracy
